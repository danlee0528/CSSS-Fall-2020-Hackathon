# Purpose
- To develop an application that has tittle made from acronyms such as SFU, CSSS, LISP, LEAF, GO and ASCII

# Problem Statement
- It is well-kwown among Vancouverites that booking a knowledge test at ICBC is really chanllening. Even less-populated, remote places like Kamloops have most of their appointments booked. Even more, it's very cumbersome to check each date for availability when appointments are booked for the next year. To solve this problem, we aim to automate the booking process by selecting date, month, year, preference, location, and filling information. 

# Technology
 - Selenium for testing
 - Python for scripting
 
# To run the program
1. source virtual-env/bin/activate
2. python3 python_org_search.py

# Case Studies
- The current version of the program is given pre-defined options to fill their appointment form. To make the program more robust, it is highly recommended to design a GUI or website-like form for users to choose their preferences of services, dates and etc.
