# Purpose
- To develop an application that has tittle made from acronyms such as SFU, CSSS, LISP, LEAF, GO and ASCII

# Problem Statement
- It is well-kwown among Vancouverites that booking a knowledge test at ICBC is really chanllening. Even less-populated, remote places like Kamloops have most of their appointments booked. Even more, it's very cumbersome to check each date for availability when appointments are booked for the next year. To solve this problem, we aim to automate the booking process by selecting date, month, year, preference, location, and filling information.
